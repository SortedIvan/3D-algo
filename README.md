# 3D Algorithm Visualizer
A visualization environment (built with Unity3D) of sorting and search algorithms <br/>
The idea of this project is to create an interactable environment where the user may explore different algorithms and how they work, but in 3D! <br/>
The project will eventually contain a simple movement system and interaction board where the user may control the speed of the algorithms and input different colors, as well as having the ability to reverse the order, etc. <br/>

Currently the project contains: <br/>
- Bubble Sort <br/>

- Selection Sort <br/>
